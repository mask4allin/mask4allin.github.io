Do-it-yourself masks help flatten the curve. Wear them in public and slow down the spread of COVID-19.

### I have no time. Give me a quick summary.

Wear a mask if at all you have to go out. A simple cloth mask will reduce your risk significantly.

Countries where citizens are wearing masks have slowed down the spread significantly. Let us add India to that list:

### Do I need specialized masks?

No! Just a mask from a simple cotton blend is fine. Use your old t-shirt or your old towel to make a mask.
